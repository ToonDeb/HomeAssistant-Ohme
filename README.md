# Ohme EV Charger for Home Assistant

A basic integration for interacting with Ohme EV Chargers.

This has only be tested with an Ohme Home Pro and does not currently support social login or accounts with multiple chargers.

It's still very early in development but I plan to add more sensors and support for pausing/resuming charge.

## Installation

1. Install with HACS or manually
2. Enter your Ohme credentials
